    <th class="tg-y7qa">1. To ensure that students are fully focused on learning during curriculum hours and are not distracted by calls, messages or use of social media, the school has a strict mobile phone policy. <br><br>2. The policy prohibits the use of mobile phones during curriculum hours and students are required to switch their mobile phones to silent mode and place them in their assigned lockers at the start of each school day. <br><br>3. Students are allowed to retrieve their phones from their lockers during recess and after the last lesson of the day. Mobile phones may only be used in three designated zones: the General Office foyer, the school canteen, and either school gate.<br><br>4. Students who are found using their mobile phones at an unauthorised time or place will have their device confiscated and held in a safe at the General Office until the end of the school day.<br><br>5. Recalcitrant students who have their phones confiscated multiple times will face escalating consequences, such as confiscation of their phone for a period of one week after the second offence, and one month after the third offence. <br><br>6. In case of emergency, parents/ guardians can call the General Office to get in touch with a student.<br><br>7. For non-emergencies, parents/ guardians can SMS the student and leave a message for him/her to return a message/call when they are within the designated mobile devices zones or after curriculum hours or during recess breaks.</th>
