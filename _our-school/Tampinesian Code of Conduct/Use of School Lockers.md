<p><strong>All students will be provided with lockers located along the corridors outside their classroom.</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Locker Allocation:</strong> Each student will be assigned a locker
corresponding to their class register number. <u>No swapping is allowed.</u>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lock Usage:</strong> For security, students will only be allowed
to use lockers with a lock. Unsecured lockers will be cable-tied to prevent
unauthorized usage.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lock Distribution:</strong> At the start, the school will provide
each student with a one-off combination lock (worth $4.50) for their locker.
In case of loss or damage, a replacement can be purchased at the school
bookshop. Alternatively, students may use a combination lock from home,
if it fits the locker.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage Guidelines</strong>: Students are encouraged to store their
Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), textbooks, and other learning materials
in their lockers to help keep their bags light and be well-prepared for
lessons. Mobile phones should also be stored in lockers and should not
be used during class time. Food, smelly clothes / shoes / boots cannot
be stored in lockers.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End of Semester Maintenance</strong>: All lockers must be cleaned
and cleared with locks removed, by the last week of each Semester, before
the start of June and Nov/Dec school holidays. Students will be reminded
when to start this process and items left in their locker at the end of
the semester will be discarded.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety and Responsibility</strong>: Lockers are school property,
and students are expected to care for them responsibly. Please note that
for safety and hygiene reasons, school staff have the right to open and
check lockers when necessary. Any misuse or damage will be subject to disciplinary
action, and the cost of repairs will be borne by the student.</p>
