Students will receive a Conduct Grade at the end of Semester 1 and Semester 2 together with the semestral HDP Report. To further understand the expectations of all students and what is required of a student to achieve a good conduct grade, students should look through the rubrics below that are used to determine the Conduct Grade.

Please note that a Fair Conduct grade affects studentsâ€™ eligibility for MOE Edusave and school awards.
