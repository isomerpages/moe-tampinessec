As Tampines Secondary School marks its 40th year, we do so with deep gratitude for our journey and confidence in the future we are shaping together. Over four decades, TPSS has grown into a caring community built on strong relationships, shared values, and a deep belief in the potential of every student.

At the heart of our school is the vision of _A Caring Community of Learners, Thinkers and Leaders_. We believe that learning happens everywhere—not just in classrooms, but through authentic experiences that spark curiosity, encourage exploration, and build confidence. Our students grow as learners who are curious and resilient, thinkers who analyse and innovate, and leaders who act with empathy and purpose.

Our 2026 theme, _“A Better Me to Embody a We-First_ Spirit_,”_ captures what we value most. At TPSS, personal growth is inseparable from responsibility to others. We nurture students to strive for improvement while learning to care, collaborate, and contribute meaningfully to the wider community.

Looking ahead, we are strengthening future-ready learning through Creative Engineering and Creative Expression, our two distinctive programmes. Through Creative Engineering, students design and innovate solutions to real-world challenges with purpose and community impact. Through Creative Expression, they build the confidence to communicate ideas clearly, advocate for causes they care about, and engage others with empathy. Together, these experiences deepen student agency—enabling students to create with purpose, advocate with heart, and make a meaningful difference to the community.

Care remains central to who we are. TPSS is a school where students are known, supported, and guided within a safe and structured environment. Strong partnerships with parents and the community enable us to nurture students’ well-being, character, and sense of responsibility alongside academic growth.

To mark our 40th anniversary meaningfully, TPSS will embark on 40 projects that benefit our school community and beyond. These initiatives—led by students, staff, alumni and partners—reflect our belief that learning and leadership are expressed through service and positive impact. Through these projects, students experience firsthand what it means to grow as individuals while uplifting others—a true embodiment of a we-first spirit.

As we honour our past and look forward with hope, we invite parents, students, alumni, and partners to journey with us. Together, we will continue to shape Tampines Secondary School as a place where learners grow, thinkers thrive, and leaders rise—ready to make a meaningful difference in school, in the community, and beyond.
