A warm welcome to the Tampines Secondary School (TPSS) website!    
  
In this section, I hope to share some messages that are timeless and relevant for all stakeholders, old and new alike.  At the same time, I will weave in some of the areas of focus in 2022.  
  
Similar to last year, let us take a moment to reflect on the past, so as to glean insights from our experiences and to better position ourselves for the journey ahead.  
  
Compared to 2020, 2021 had been an equally challenging year.  We had to go through various Safe Management Measures and adapt to different modes of teaching, so as to ensure that both effective learning and overall well-being of our students were taken care of.  Again, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the school staff, students and parents for their kind understanding and unwavering efforts, working hand-in-hand to overcome the various challenges throughout the academic year.  It is once again a testament of our school values – Courage to deal with the unknown, Adaptability in the face of changing situations and Respect for fellow members of the Tampinesian family.  If I may add, it also reflects the TPSS spirit of a caring community, where everyone cares for and supports one another, through both good and trying times.  
  
We celebrated our 35th Anniversary in 2021.  As part of the celebrations, we curated the voices of our stakeholders.  I am heartened to hear about the numerous stories of nostalgia and achievements shared by both former and current staff and students.  I believe that these stories will inspire us to continue in our mission to provide a well-rounded education in a nurturing environment to prepare Tampinesians for the future.

*“Education is a social process; education is growth; education is not preparation for life but is life itself.”
 ― John Dewey*
 
 I shared the above quote last year, and I would like to share it again.  Indeed, education is life itself.  Even while we prepare our students for the future, the experiences they gained throughout the process form a crucial part of their learning.  This crucial part of their life-long learning is life itself.  For example, on the academic front, we have rolled out the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for every student to own a Personal Learning Device (PLD) to support their learning.  With e-pedagogy, our teachers have begun to leverage technology to create participatory, connected and reflective classrooms for active learning.  Through these efforts, our students are learning valuable ICT and productivity skills and integrating the use of PLD in their everyday lives.  Hence, besides being more future-ready, students also benefit from a richer learning experience, beyond the physical boundaries of the classroom.  We will continue to strengthen our e-pedagogical approaches and our use of PLD in the areas of teaching & learning and co-curricular activities in 2022.  
  
In 2022, we will also focus more on Education and Career Guidance (ECG) for our students.  At TPSS, we want to ensure our students are clear about the multiple pathways available for them post-secondary.  We want them to start developing their career aspirations and understand what they need to do now in order to realise these aspirations.  We believe that good ECG will serve as a strong motivator for our students, to encourage them to strive to excel.  To achieve this, we are strengthening our ECG curriculum and exploring innovative ways to bring the information to our students and help them discover their strengths and passions.  
  
As the saying goes, “our children are only as wonderful as we allow them to be.”  At TPSS, we strive to give our students the most conducive learning environment and the best possible opportunities for them to flourish.  With the support and the collaboration of our stakeholders – teachers, students, parents and partners, I am confident that we can provide a holistic and enriching educational experience for all Tampinesians, to realise our school’s vision of a caring community of Learners, Thinkers and Leaders.  
  
Yours faithfully,
