Dear Parents, Students, Staff, and Members of the TPSS Family,

It is an honour and privilege to join *Tampines Secondary School* as your new Principal. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to my predecessor, Mr Lan Mingjun, for his exemplary leadership and unwavering dedication to the growth and success of our school. His efforts have shaped TPSS into a *Caring Community of Learners, Thinkers, and Leaders* — a legacy I deeply respect and will build upon.

At TPSS, we believe in nurturing every child holistically. Guided by our *ICARE* values — **Integrity, Courage, Adaptability, Respect, and Excellence** — our mission is to empower students to be future ready, thriving as a learner, thinking critically, and leading with purpose.

Students can look forward to exciting programmes aligned with our **Learner, Thinker, Leader** framework:

*   **Learning Skills and Growth Mindset**: From our _Start Right_ initiatives to innovative lesson structures, we equip students to be self-directed learners.
*   **Critical Thinking and Creativity**: Through our *Applied Learning Programme (ALP)* in Creative Engineering, our *Learn for Life Programme (LLP)* in Creative Expression and hands-on projects, students explore real-world challenges.
*   **Leadership and Service**: Our *STARS Leadership Framework* and *Values-in-Action* programmes ensure students grow into responsible leaders who contribute meaningfully to the community.

As we chart the path forward, my focus will be on fostering a nurturing and inspiring environment where every student discovers their strengths, overcomes challenges, and builds a love for lifelong learning. Together, with our passionate teachers, supportive parents, and engaged community, I look forward to working alongside you to shape the future of TPSS.

Let us embark on this journey together — one of growth, discovery, and excellence.

Warm regards,  
Mrs Tay Yang Fern  
Principal  
Tampines Secondary School
