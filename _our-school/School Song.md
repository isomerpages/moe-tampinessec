### THE TAMPINESIAN SCHOOL SONG

_(Lyrics and music score written in 1986 by Mr John De Souza)_

Green and Gold, Green and Gold <br>
We will keep our school flag flying <br>
Green and Gold, Green and Gold <br>
We will keep our school flag flying <br>
Keep our school flag Green and Gold up high

Let education be our top priority <br>
For the betterment of self <br>
Always outward looking forward thinking <br>
Think not of oneself <br>
Think not of oneself

Working as a team <br>
We’ll steer our way upstream <br>
It’s not easy but we’ll try <br>
We will give our best to Tampines <br>
‘tis here our future lies <br>
Here our future lies
