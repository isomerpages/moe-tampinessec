### MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME (FAS)

Tampines Secondary School is a Government School. As the Ministry of Education provides financial assistance to needy Singapore students in Government or Government-Aided schools, our students may be eligible to apply for financial assistance. 

  

Detailed information about the household income requirements and benefits can be found on the MOE website: 

[MOE Financial Assistance Scheme](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance)

  

A soft-copy of the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) form can be downloaded from the above page. Alternatively, parents/guardians can also get the hard-copy application form from the school general office.   

  

Completed forms can be submitted through the school to be processed. Applicants will then be informed by the school of the outcome.
