### WHAT IS EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)?

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is developmental in nature, and seeks to meet the needs of students at every stage of their education. Through ECG, students develop social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience that will prepare them for the 21st century.

### GOALS OF ECG

**The goals of ECG are to:**

*   nurture students' self-awareness, self-directedness and life skills for continuous learning.
*   provide students with accurate and comprehensive information and enable them to explore well-thought through education and career options.
*   instill in students an appreciation for the value of all occupations and how they contribute to the society.
*   equip students with skills to positively engage their parents and other career influencers such as teachers, trusted adults and industry experts.

### ECG IN TAMPINES SECONDARY SCHOOL

In Tampines Secondary School, we aim to develop our students’ strengths, interests and abilities, so that they can contribute meaningfully to society through their future professions. Our students will learn and explore different education and career pathways as well as opportunities for continuous learning. They will be guided to make informed decisions about their education and career plans, and take steps to embark on them. Varied ECG experiences, which include talks by our ECG counsellor and partners from the Institutes of Higher Education and workshops on interview skills, support students to develop 21st century competencies, values and workplace readiness skills which will allow them to be adaptable and resilient.
