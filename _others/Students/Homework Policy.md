### DEFINITION

Homework refers to learning activities assigned by the school that students are required to complete outside of curriculum time.  This includes projects, research, e-learning, worksheets, etc.  

  

### OBJECTIVES

The school believes that carefully designed homework is beneficial to students’ learning.  Homework when used appropriately, can improve students’ academic ability, study skills and disposition towards learning.  When used inappropriately or excessively, however, homework can impact negatively on students’ achievements and motivation and reduce their access to other activities that teach important life skills.

**Effective use of homework enables pupils to**

*   gain mastery of learning and deepen conceptual understanding;  
    
*   develop skills and attitudes that will enhance his/her future academic studies and character development; and  
    
*   develop good learning habits such as time management and ownership of learning. 

**Effective use of homework enables teachers to**

*   consolidate the learning that takes place in class;  
    
*   gain insights on students’ learning and to provide feedback, intervention and support; and  
    
*   reflect and review the effectiveness of lessons.  
    

**Effective use of homework enables parents to**

*   be informed of their child’s learning progress to provide support to the child; and  
    
*   strengthen parent-child relationship.  
    

  

### GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

When planning homework, teachers need to reflect on the rationale and type of learning they want the homework to reinforce, and the quantity and quality of homework assigned.

**Quality of Homework**

*   Homework given should be well-designed to bring about the intended learning outcomes.  
    
*   The assigned homework is related to classroom teaching and is purposeful.  
    
*   The type of homework is differentiated to meet the different needs and abilities of students.  
    

  

**Quantity of Homework** 

*   Homework is allocated based on the amount of time required by an average student to complete.  
    
*   Amount of homework given is age-appropriate.  
    
*   Homework given across subjects and departments are coordinated.  
    
*   Amount of homework given considers students’ involvement in continual and semester examinations, CCA participation, time for family bonding, school activities and personal interest.
