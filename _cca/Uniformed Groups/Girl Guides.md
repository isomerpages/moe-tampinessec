#### Overview
Founded in 2015, Tampines Girl Guides (TPGG) is a Uniformed Group committed to empowering young women through values-based, non-formal education. We focus on life skills, leadership, and decision-making across five key areas: Personal, Home, Outdoors, Community, and International. Our diverse activities range from outdoor cooking and kayaking to crafts and dance.

Aligned with 21st Century Competencies, TPGG actively participates in community and national outreach. We've partnered with organisations like the Singapore Cancer Society and Institute of Mental Health, and engage in international events such as World Thinking Day.

Honoured with the Unit Puan Noor Aishah Award (Gold), we continually strive to fulfil our motto, 'Be Prepared', shaping resilient, confident, and caring citizens. #ForTheGirl!
