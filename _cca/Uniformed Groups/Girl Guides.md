### INTRODUCTION

Tampines Girl Guides (TPGG) was established in 2015, where we pride ourselves as a Uniformed Group that is dedicated to enabling girls and young women to develop their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. Girl Guiding creates youth-empowering learning experiences through a values-based and non-formal educational approach that provides training in life skills, leadership and decision-making. Our varied enrichment programmes are anchored in values that inspire and enable our girls to grow in confidence, develop life skills and take the lead in their communities.

TPGG believes in enabling our girls to become resilient, confident and caring members of the society. Following our motto, ‘Be Prepared’, we nurture our students on five main aspects: Personal, Home, Outdoors, Community, and International, and offer a diverse range of programmes such as outdoor cooking, tent-pitching, orienteering, kayaking, gadget-tying, craft, songs, dance and many more! Our Guides are also given opportunities to pursue skills of their personal interests.

In line with the 21st Century Competencies, we have embarked on a series of community and national outreach programmes to further develop our girls as active contributors to the society. Some of our special projects include the Girl Guides cookie sale for charity, and advocate for societal causes through collaborations with Singapore Cancer Society, Public Utilities Board, Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association amongst many others. We also partake in international events such as the World Thinking Day celebrations and International Camp, where our girls learn to interact with and host international visitors.

TPGG has clinched several accolades, including the Unit Puan Noor Aishah Award (Gold), which is testament to the commitment of our Guide and Guiders to their Guide Promise. Our dynamic yet rigorous Guiding programme will continue to enrich every young woman as we will always be #ForTheGirl!
