### INTRODUCTION

     style="width:75%">

The history of St. John Brigade (SJB) in Tampines Secondary School can be traced back to 1986, when it became one of the 4 Uniformed Groups (NPCC, NCC, SJB and School Military Band) that were first introduced in the school after its official opening. The first St. John squad was made up of 16 cadets and they were trained by Officers and Non Commissioned Officers (N.C.Os) from Dunman High School. The first St. John Teacher In-Charge of the school was Mrs Low Leng who was once a St. John member during her schooling days.

SJB in Tampines Secondary School belonged to Area 8 District D and all the cadets in the same Area and District had to put on yellow nametags. In 1996, the Brigade was restructured and the District level was replaced by the Zone level. From then onwards, SJB in Tampines Secondary School became a part of Zone 8. In 2020, the Brigade was restructured again to organise schools according to geographical districts. We are now part of the East District.

Today, SJB (also known as TPSJB) continues to thrive as a dynamic Uniformed Group that is characterized by a strong sense of volunteerism, self-belief and forward movement. TPSJB offers a wide spectrum of skills and courses for its cadets such as First Aid and Home Nursing skills, foot drills, Leadership development and Transportation of Casualties. The cadets are given opportunities to render their services to those in suffering as well as public duties.

TPSJB continues to conduct training programmes and enrichment activities for the cadets so as to equip them with 21st century skills.
