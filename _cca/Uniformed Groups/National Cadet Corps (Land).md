### WHY JOIN NCC?

Reasons to join TPSS NCC(Land)

1.  We help you prepare for National Service. All Uniformed Groups (UGs) have a common syllabus (Footdrill, Outdoor Adventure, First Aid, Community Service, Total Defence) but each UG has a speciality. Our speciality is unique. NCC(Land) syllabus includes most of the skills you will learn in Basic Military Training and you will get a chance to visit SAF camps to gain more exposure. Being in NCC(Land) might even increase your chances to get selected to go to Officer Cadet School (OCS) or Specialist Cadet School (SCS) after BMT!  
    
2.  NCC gives you the chance to handle the Singapore Assault Rifle (SAR 21) and shoot with it! (It is way powerful than any revolver!)  
    
3.  We have sufficient physical activities to keep you fit. Fitness is important for boys.  
    
4.  You will get the chance to be a real leader. Cadet Leaders and Senior Cadet Leaders will lead the cadets and take on responsibilities in the administration of the unit. They work with the Commanding Officer and Teacher Officers to plan camps and other major training exercises.  
    
5.  You will enjoy the company of like-minded boys and make new friends.  
    
6.  CCA is not about points â€“ but you will be pleased to note that it is easy to get 2 aggregate bonus for your National Exams if you are in the NCC. All our ACTIVE cadets have at least an A2 CCA grade
