### Vision
To inculcate positive ideologies amongst the young impressionable minds in strengthening their cultural beliefs.

### Mission 
To promote appreciation and awareness of the Malay culture and practices through exhibition and exposition of Malay Dance.

### Introduction 
The TPSS Malay Dance group, more fondly known as Dendang Remaja, is involved in many stage performances, both inside and outside of school. Starting at an early age, the junior as well as senior dancers are exposed to indoor and outdoor performances to enhance their stage confidence and presence. At the same time, we also aim to promote Malay Dance to the community at large.
