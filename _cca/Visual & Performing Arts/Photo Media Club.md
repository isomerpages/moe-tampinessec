### INTRODUCTION

Photography and videography classes are conducted by the teacher-in-charge, Mr James Tan, and the Lead and Senior photographers throughout the year. Students are trained progressively from the beginner stage. Basic skills include camera handling and the all-important “exposure triangle”.

  

In 2020, a special group of photographers was formed. This initial group was taught more advanced photographic skills to enable them to serve the school by taking high quality photos. They are the ones the school can rely on to provide photography and videography services for all activities and events. In 2021, this group undertook the 35th Anniversary project of taking a “family” photo of every student.

  

The PMC also provides public address system (PA system) services to the school. Every PA system needs good operators: students who can think on their feet to provide the best solution to every situation, and to trouble shoot when things do not go as planned. In addition, the club trains students to be professionals in sound and lights so as to provide the best experience for the audience.&nbsp;

**HIGHLIGHTS**

*   Students will complete their photography course by end of Semester 1. Their grading was carried out at a themed photo project. Their works are planned to be exhibited in school.  
    
*   Successful course attendees are then tasked to take up photo assignments in most school activities including the school concerts, Speech Day, Mass Run, Fiesta.
