### Introduction

Photography and videography classes are conducted by the teacher-in-charge, Mr James Tan, and the Lead and Senior photographers throughout the year. Students are trained progressively from the beginner stage. Basic skills include camera handling and the all-important “exposure triangle”.

In 2020, a special group of photographers was formed. This initial group was taught more advanced photographic skills to enable them to serve the school by taking high quality photos. They are the ones the school can rely on to provide photography and videography services for all activities and events. In 2021, this group undertook the 35th Anniversary project of taking a “family” photo of every student. They were also tasked to record the National Day Ceremony, to be played as the Covid-19 situation was fluid.

Since then, the club has grown from strength to strength: In 2022, the club was tasked with taking the individual photos of all the Sec 1 and 3 students. These photos were used in creating contact sheets for form teachers.

In 2023, this role was expanded. The club was tasked with taking ALL group photos of the school: Staff and Department photos, CCA photos and Class photos.

The PMC also provides public address system (PA system) services to the school. Every PA system needs good operators: students who can think on their feet to provide the best solution to every situation, and to trouble shoot when things do not go as planned. In addition, the club trains students to be professionals in sound and lights so as to provide the best experience for the audience.
