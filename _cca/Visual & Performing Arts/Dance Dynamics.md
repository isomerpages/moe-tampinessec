### Introduction

Dance Dynamics is a talent incubator that immerses students in diverse dance genres, from hip hop and urban to street jazz. Trainings held twice a week focus on enhancing physical strength, foundational techniques, and choreography skills.

Beyond the dance floor, the programme cultivates resilience, discipline, and teamwork. Through creating our own routines and collaborating, students learn essential skills such as communication, cooperation, and compromise.

Our co-curricular activity (CCA) boasts a strong performance record. We offer numerous opportunities for public performances, including school events and competitions like the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and Super24. In 2018, we secured the 1st Runner Up position in the Secondary National Championships for Super 24. More recently, we earned a five-star achievement in the 2022 Open Dance Competition organised by the People's Association. Additionally, Dance Dynamics has been consistently awarded a Distinction at the SYF for the last five consecutive rounds, including 2023.
