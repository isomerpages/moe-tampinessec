### Vision 
Inherit the art of Chinese Dance and pass on the love for Chinese Culture to the next generation.

### Mission 
To promote appreciation and awareness of the Chinese Culture and Instill the love for dance in our students.

### Introduction 
Our dancers are trained in diverse genres like Chinese dance, contemporary dance, and ballet, nurturing their potential in each. We also offer enrichment programmes focused on dance appreciation, coupled with workshops and public performances. These opportunities hone their techniques and broaden their experience.

Our resident instructor, Ms. Zhao Yiming, specializes in Chinese and contemporary dance. Typically, half of our annual training sessions delve into Chinese dance techniques, while the remaining sessions cover ballet and contemporary dance.

Notably, we have had promising students identified during our training who were recommended for further training at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.
