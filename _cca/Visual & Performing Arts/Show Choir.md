### Mission 
We are committed to build the Choir members’ confidence in self-expression through elements of singing and dancing while engaging with different audiences.


### Introduction 
The Show Choir prides ourselves in combining choral singing along with choreography in our performances. We have quality instructors who passionately guide the choir members to develop innovative and creative freedom of expression and broaden their perspectives through singing a repertoire of songs from different cultures and genres. 

As performers, the students learn the techniques on vocal projection and quality in singing. Students also learn the importance of dance showmanship to better express themselves through movement and body gestures.
