### A HOLISTIC EDUCATION FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS

#### CO-CURRICULAR ATTAINMENT RECOGNITION SCHEME LEAPS 2.0

As part of its efforts to provide students with a holistic and well-rounded experience in the co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) implemented an updated LEAPS framework, LEAPS 2.0, in 2014. The updated framework enables schools to better align their co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic development in terms&nbsp;of life skills, competencies and values.

#### LEAP 2.0

Participation&nbsp;Achievement,&nbsp;Leadership, and&nbsp;Service) is a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic development. Students will be recognised with levels (1 to 5) of attainment in four domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.

#### Participation
This domain recognises the student’s participation (attendance) in school-based Co-curricular Activities (CCA) for the development of specific knowledge and skills, be it in Clubs and Societies (C&amp;S), Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups (UG) or Visual and Performing Arts (VPA). Sustained engagement over four to five years in a chosen CCA allows for the progressive development of skills and knowledge, character development, forging of friendships and building of team spirit.

#### Achievement 
This domain recognises the different levels of representation and accomplishment in the student’s involvement in school or other external organisations. Representing the school or external organisations in competitions, festivals or their equivalent provides the platform for students to actualise and showcase their talent as well as benchmark their level of mastery. The opportunity to go through the learning process, be disciplined and rigorous in preparation, and strive for excellence presents valuable learning experiences for the student. Accomplishments (e.g. winning medals, accolades and awards) at these platforms are also recognised.

#### Leadership 
This domain recognises the development of the student’s leadership dispositions as an individual who can lead himself/herself, work with others in a team and grow as a leader to become a confident person. It recognises a plethora of school leadership learning opportunities, ranging from participation in student leadership programmes, to leading projects, to formal leadership appointments.

#### Service 
This domain recognises the student’s development as an individual who is socially responsible and understands his/her role in contributing to the well-being of others. Participation in Values-in-Action (VIA) projects such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership and identify the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate action among peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.

#### Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment – LEAPS 2.0
At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/ MI/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/MI/Poly/ITE).
