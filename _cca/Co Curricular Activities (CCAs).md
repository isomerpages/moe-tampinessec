<h3>A HOLISTIC EDUCATION FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS</h3>
<h4>CO-CURRICULAR ATTAINMENT RECOGNITION SCHEME LEAPS 2.0</h4>
<p>As part of its efforts to provide students with a holistic and well-rounded
experience in the co-curriculum, the Ministry of Education (MOE) implemented
an updated LEAPS framework, LEAPS 2.0, in 2014. The updated framework enables
schools to better align their co-curriculum to encourage students’ holistic
development in terms&nbsp;of life skills, competencies and values.</p>
<h4>LEAP 2.0</h4>
<p>Participation&nbsp;Achievement,&nbsp;Leadership, and&nbsp;Service) is
a framework to recognise secondary school students’ holistic development.
Students will be recognised with levels (1 to 5) of attainment in four
domains: Participation, Achievement, Leadership and Service.</p>
<h4>Participation</h4>
<p>This domain recognises the student’s participation (attendance) in school-based
Co-curricular Activities (CCA) for the development of specific knowledge
and skills, be it in Clubs and Societies (C&amp;S), Physical Sports, Uniformed
Groups (UG) or Visual and Performing Arts (VPA). Sustained engagement over
four to five years in a chosen CCA allows for the progressive development
of skills and knowledge, character development, forging of friendships
and building of team spirit.</p>
<h4>Achievement</h4>
<p>This domain recognises the different levels of representation and accomplishment
in the student’s involvement in school or other external organisations.
Representing the school or external organisations in competitions, festivals
or their equivalent provides the platform for students to actualise and
showcase their talent as well as benchmark their level of mastery. The
opportunity to go through the learning process, be disciplined and rigorous
in preparation, and strive for excellence presents valuable learning experiences
for the student. Accomplishments (e.g. winning medals, accolades and awards)
at these platforms are also recognised.</p>
<h4>Leadership</h4>
<p>This domain recognises the development of the student’s leadership dispositions
as an individual who can lead himself/herself, work with others in a team
and grow as a leader to become a confident person. It recognises a plethora
of school leadership learning opportunities, ranging from participation
in student leadership programmes, to leading projects, to formal leadership
appointments.</p>
<h4>Service</h4>
<p>This domain recognises the student’s development as an individual who
is socially responsible and understands his/her role in contributing to
the well-being of others. Participation in Values-in-Action (VIA) projects
such as service-learning encourages the student to take ownership and identify
the community issues they are concerned about, and initiate action among
peers to make a difference and improve the lives of others.</p>
<h4>Recognition of Students’ Level of Attainment – LEAPS 2.0</h4>
<p>At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment
will be recognised according to Excellent/Good/Fair. The level of attainment
will be converted to a bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to
Junior Colleges/ MI/ Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/MI/Poly/ITE).</p>
