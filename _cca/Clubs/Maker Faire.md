### INTRODUCTION

Makerspaces workshops were held in TPSS in the year 2016. Students were exposed to apply what they have learnt in the classroom to solve real life problems. They were allowed to “tinker” with LED shoes, scribbling machines, table top robots, 3D pen and electronically generated music.&nbsp;

  

In 2017, the students participated in the MOE Excel Fest, and were privileged to share their project with educators. This year, they reached out to even more people with their booth at the Maker Faire Singapore which was open to the public.
