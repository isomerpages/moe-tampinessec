### Introduction
Maker@Tpss is a hands-on and project-based CCA that emphasizes creativity, innovation, and problem-solving. Students in our CCA have access to a dedicated makerspace where they can use a variety of tools and materials to design, build, and create their own projects.

Maker Education CCA students are encouraged to apply their knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. They may work on projects in a variety of areas, including engineering, design, technology, and art.

### Highlights &amp; Achievements
Makerspaces workshops were held in TPSS in the year 2016. Students were exposed to apply what they have learnt in the classroom to solve real life problems. They were allowed to “tinker” with LED shoes, scribbling machines, table top robots, 3D pen and electronically generated music.

In 2017, the students participated in the MOE Excel Fest, and were privileged to share their project with educators. This year, they reached out to even more people with their booth at the Maker Faire Singapore which was open to the public.
