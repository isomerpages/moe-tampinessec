### INTRODUCTION


All Infocomm Club members will be trained in animation and game design training. The club aims that every club member 

is equipped with the animation and game designing skills so as to unleash their talent in animation and challenge their potential 

by participating in national competitions. Infocomm club members are also cyber wellness ambassadors. They will be trained to be advocates of cyber wellness in school as well as the community.

### HIGHLIGHTS


Cyber Wellness and Animation and Game Designing are the two key events and the areas of focus for the Infocomm Club this year. Infocomm Club members will be gearing up to produce posters and comics based on cyber safety. These posters and comics will be shared with the school on the official social media platforms. 

  

Last year, at least 95% of the ICC members participated in the national NEmation competition. 5 teams were shortlisted to be in the Top 100. Out of the 5 teams, 4 teams were selected for the qualifying rounds and finally, 1 team emerged as a Top 10 Finalist. Well done to the team, the Average Animators!

  

Besides being involved in Cyber Wellness activities and participating in NEmation national competitions, the club is also undergoing intensive training on games development using CoSpaces. By the end of the training, we hope that the students will be able to create their own games related to Cyber Wellness.
