### Vision
To Serve with Excellence and Bring Visualisation to Life

### Mission 
To cultivate the students’ passion for different forms of Digital Media particularly in digital animation tool and game design.

### Introduction 
All Infocomm Club members receive training in animation and game design. Our goal is to empower each member with these skills, enabling them to showcase their animation talent and compete at national levels. Additionally, our members serve as cyber wellness ambassadors, championing online safety both in school and the broader community.

### Highlights &amp; Achievements
This year, the Infocomm Club is focusing on Cyber Wellness and Animation &amp; Game Designing. Our members are creating cyber safety-themed posters and comics, which will be featured on the school's official social media platforms.

Additionally, our concentration spans Artificial Intelligence, animation, and cyber wellness. Sec 2s and Sec 3s are delving deeper into Artificial Intelligence through a rigorous 36-hour training during their CCA. This culminates in a workshop at Temasek Polytechnic's School of Information and Technology on May 29, 2023. Meanwhile, Sec 1s collaborated with Sec 4s to produce Lego animation clips on Cyber Citizenship. These clips were then highlighted during a Cyber Wellness roadshow, prompting Tampinesians to pledge their commitment to cyber wellness at our booth. Furthermore, Sec 4s had the honor of promoting Cyber Citizenship during a morning assembly, enhancing the overall experience for all club members.

On another note, we're immensely proud of our team who participated in the National Cyber Wellness Advocacy Challenge 2022: Gonzales Alexandra Isabelle Jabola (4E1), Ilhan Danial Bin Yussri (4E2), Tan Yu Han Celeste, and Jarrett Seow Jia Yu (4E4). They secured a Bronze Award in this esteemed competition. Congratulations to the team!
