### Introduction

![](/images/football%20titans%20banner.png)

Established in early 2009, the Tampines TiTANS are dedicated to nurturing athletic talent in each member. Beyond the pursuit of sporting excellence, we aim to set a positive example by upholding the highest standards of sportsmanship and integrity.

We are not only involved in school-based sports; we actively seek out external competitions and tournaments hosted by football clubs, academies, and organizations. To further engage with the community, we host an annual free football carnival for primary schools.

Members of the TiTANS can expect to compete in friendly matches at least monthly. Additionally, we participate in tournaments during the June and December school breaks. Every March, the team also competes in the annual National School Games.

### Highlights &amp; Achievements

The year 2023 marked a significant chapter for both the TPSS Titans and Titanides as competitions resumed in full force. We actively participated in every division of this year's Football NSG.

This was a milestone year for us, as it was the first time we inducted DSA students into our football teams. Four of these players contributed to the C Division Titans, who advanced to the Tier 2 League but narrowly missed the Quarterfinals, landing us among the top 32 schools in Singapore. The B Division Titans competed in the Tier 3 League and reached the Quarterfinals, ultimately falling to St. Joseph's Institution and securing a spot among the top 40 schools.

Our female athletes had a standout year, with the B Division Titanides going unbeaten and making history by reaching our first NSG National Finals. Although they fought valiantly, they were narrowly defeated in penalty kicks by Meridian Secondary. The C Division Titanides also made history by becoming our first team to play at the National Stadium for the 3rd/4th place match, where they ultimately secured 4th place.

It's been an uplifting return to competitive school football, and we are grateful for the valuable lessons learned through the highs and lows of the season. These experiences have contributed significantly to the character development of our CCA members. We're eager to build on this momentum and aim for even greater achievements in 2024. Thank you, Tampinesians, for your unwavering support!
