### Introduction

The TPSS Badminton CCA comprises Teams A, B and C.  
  
The Badminton CCA organizes tournaments such as Pines Cup for Primary Schools and facilitates Tampines Secondary School’s Inter-House Badminton tournaments, with the objective of providing opportunities for our members to hone their organizational and leadership skills.  
  

The varied Leadership, Enrichment, Achievement, Participation and Service opportunities offered by this CCA have empowered the students to be all-rounded students who excel on all fronts and have what it takes to overcome future challenges.

### TRAINING ACTIVITIES &amp; SCHEDULE

All our training sessions are professionally conducted by our resident coach, together with our team of dedicated teachers. Our trainings are conducted at the school Multi-Purpose Hall and Indoor Sports Hall.&nbsp;

There are three components to our trainings, namely court work movement and strategies, mental concentration, and physical conditioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Court work movement and strategies include movement around the court, as well as strategies that are employed during gameplay.&nbsp;

Mental concentration is a critical aspect of the Badminton game. Hence it is crucial for our competitive members to possess grit and tenacity when they are on court.&nbsp;

Physical trainings are conducted strategically with game requirements in mind, resulting in all our players achieving high levels of physical fitness. Many of them are also accredited with Gold Awards in the annual NAPFA Test, with a good proportion of them clinching the NAPFA Special Gold Award.&nbsp;

Besides our effective training components, we also constantly inject an element of fun into our sessions. It is without a doubt that our members enjoy their trainings and through their years with the team, they become skilful team players with grit.
