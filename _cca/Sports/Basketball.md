Our players train and participate in different competitions such as the East Zone Basketball Championships and the National School Championships.

The Girls Team participates in both 'B' and 'C' Division competitions, but we come together to train as a single team in every training session.

### HIGHLIGHTS

Our students enjoyed a clinic with the Singapore Slingers. Thank you for the Basketball Clinic. See you again!
