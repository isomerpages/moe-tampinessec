#### Sound Bites

“Being part of the basketball team has been an incredible experience. We have fostered priceless friendships and unparalleled team spirit. If given the opportunity, I would do it all over again!<br>

“As a secondary 4 student, I've realized that this is my final year participating in NSG. With this, I gave my all to the team. Although we fell short of victory, I've come to understand that basketball is not just about winning; it's about the bonds formed with teammates, coaches, and teachers. The joy of victories and the heartache of losses have given me a deeper appreciation for these connections. The strong relationships forged through these experiences are treasures I will carry with me for life.<br>
