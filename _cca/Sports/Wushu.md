### Introduction

Established in March 2003, the TPSS Wushu Team was set up to foster a better understanding of the Chinese culture and also to improve students’ fitness. Subsequently, a more competitive element was added with a focus on sports training. Today, it is a CCA that is considered both a performing art and a sport. With the guidance of our experienced coach, our training programme emphasises discipline, respect and resilience. We celebrate the progress made by our students who are given leadership opportunities and over the years, they develop physical strength, precision and flexibility through Wushu.
