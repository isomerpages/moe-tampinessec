### Introduction


**TRAINING SESSIONS INCLUDE:**

* Endurance runs, interval sprints, strength training&nbsp;  

* Ball drills

* Court strategy &nbsp;&nbsp;

* Friendly matches with other schools during holidays.&nbsp;

  

**LEARNER:**

Players undergo twice weekly training sessions with a coach. They will learn how to play the sport at a competitive level. The secondary one players will learn the basics of netball such as the rules, footwork (how to land and pivot), the varied types of passing the ball, and simple court craft.

The secondary two to four players will work on levelling up their fitness levels and more complex court crafts relating to the position that they are playing.

**THINKER:**

After each competition, the players will reflect on how the game went and what they did well and where they went wrong, they will discuss and find out some strategies for themselves to use. They continue to find ways in how to play better the next time round, as a team and individually.

During each match, players are highly encouraged to talk to one another to help each other improve and also to help one another catch blind spots.

Players will reflect on their conduct during training session as a team and individually.

**LEADER:**

Our students in both B and C divisions are given opportunities to practise personal leadership during physical and court training.

Captains and ICs are actively engaged in providing encouragement, coordination and guidance to their peers.
