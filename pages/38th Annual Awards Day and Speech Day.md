Group contingents, accompanied by the vibrant performances of our Concert
Band. Following this, our Performing Arts CCAs will take the stage, showcasing
their talent and dedication. The event will culminate in an awards presentation
ceremony, honouring the hard work and commitment of Tampinesians. These
moments serve to recognise the perseverance, talent and spirit of excellence
in our school community.</p>
