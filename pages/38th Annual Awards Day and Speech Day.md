Tampines Secondary School proudly presents its 37th Annual Awards Day and Speech Day, scheduled for the 9th and 12th of May 2023, respectively. These momentous occasions celebrate the remarkable achievements and successes of our dedicated students. This year's Speech Day theme, 'With Compassion and Courage, Growing Stronger Together,' encapsulates the collaborative spirit of our Tampinesians, who have supported one another on their journeys toward growth and excellence.

The Speech Day festivities will commence with a parade formation by our Uniformed Group contingents, who will be accompanied by the melodic tunes of our Concert Band. Following this, attendees will be treated to captivating performances from our talented Performing Arts CCAs. The event will then culminate in an awards presentation ceremony, where we will honour the outstanding achievements of our deserving students.
