Mr Adrian Phuah is one of the rare few fellow pupils who can claim to be the pioneer batch at TPSS. He could recall vividly how TPSS began operating at a holding school in Tampines before moving to the current site.As a pioneer batch he relished every lesson at TPSS especially History and Maths which has given him the good foundation to further upgrade himself academically.Although three decades have elapsed, Mr Phuah is grateful for the selfless support and encouragement that teachers have given him. He still keeps in contact with the teachers who had taught him through Facebook. He believes that the teachers influence has certainly made an impact on his aspiration which led him to be in the current profession as lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. He remarked “I still feel I owe a great debt to these people (teachers).”

Although Mr Phua spent his secondary school days in the pre Internet era, he claims that it was a boon as his classmates were able to bond better without the distractions of the electronic gadgets. Mr Phuah was able to bond with his school mates playing table tennis.  

Mr Phuah believes that the school environment played a crucial role in developing in close bonds as there were sufficient amenities to enable students to spend their time there to revise or complete their homework.  As estate was relatively new there were no shopping malls or cinemas to distract the pupils. This enabled most pupils to spend their time in school engaged in CCA’s or remedials.

_Mr Phuah concluded his thoughts about his time at Tampines Secondary with the following:_

_“One strong point I see from the people at TPSS is that they persevered \[lah\], they really really persevered. We are not the best in the grades arena you know we are not the RIs or the Dunman Highs, but i think, beyond grades, the rest of the students have done well. Whether is it grades or not”_

_“At the end of the day... It is about what you want to make yourself to be.It's not only about grades._

_**Don't let grades bring you down.   <br>
Continue to persevere.**   <br>
That's what I see in a lot of my friends out there.”_
