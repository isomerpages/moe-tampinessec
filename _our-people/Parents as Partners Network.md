### PPN @ TPSS

Our school values home-school partnerships and strongly believes that parents’ support is essential for students to thrive in school.

In 2003, the school established our parent support group named Parents as Partners Network (PPN) to engage parents who wish to contribute to the school’s efforts. These parents contribute their time and effort in collaboration with us on their children’s educational experience.

Our strong PPN Executive Committee consists of many passionate and committed parents who meet regularly and work with the school on various programmes and projects that benefit both parents and students.

PPN Executive Committee also collaborated with us and supported several school events such as Mass Run, Teachers’ Day celebration, NE events, ECG talks and Parent-Teen bonding activities. Their efforts to encourage parent participation at these school events helps to make the school a welcoming and supportive place for parents.
