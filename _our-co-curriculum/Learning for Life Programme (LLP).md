<h3>The Tampinesian Arts Philosophy</h3>
<p>The arts refers to a dynamic range of creative expressions including visual
art, music, drama, and dance. Central to this creative community is our
human need to reflect on the individual’s purpose in society, and to learn
new ways of communicating meaning between one another.</p>
<p>The arts allows us to safely explore imagined worlds, extend our perspectives
to others’ situations, and examine our individuality and humanity. In Tampines
Secondary School, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) harnesses the arts
as a vibrant learning domain with fresh pedagogical possibilities to provide
students with discoveries on their character and holistic growth. We are
proud to accompany our students on our LLP journey entitled:</p>
<p><strong>Creative expressions:</strong><em>Character development through visual and performing arts.</em>
</p>
<p>By actively involving students in artistic exposure, artistic creation,
and artistic outreach, our LLP forms a core component of the&nbsp;school’s
co-curriculum. Learning through the arts, our students will embody intellectual
curiosity in art-making, tenacity in&nbsp;learning attitude, and steadfast
values in collaborative endeavours. Above all, Tampinesians should grow
through our LLP to&nbsp;become individuals of good character who are responsible
to family, community, and nation.</p>

<p>Students’ aesthetic development is structured into Tier 1 exposure for
all students, and Tier 2 engagement for Visual and Performing Arts CCAs
members.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1</strong> arts enrichment are grouped under Platforms for
Lifelong Artistic Youths (PLAY).</p>
<p>In this category, every Tampinesian gets to experience various art forms
throughout the 4-5 years in the school. These activities range from visual
arts like batik painting, metal tooling, mosaic art to playing the ukulele
or vigorous activities such as hip-hop dance.</p>

<p><em>Mosaic art is just like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle - it engages students both cognitively and aesthetically. </em>
</p>
<p>As part of Tampines Secondary School’s Creative Expression LLP, Secondary
Two students undergo a 14-week Devised Drama Workshop where they take on
roles such as actor, director, or stage manager. Supported by professional
instructors, they bring scripts on contemporary issues to life through
rehearsal and performance, learning to express themselves clearly and confidently.
In the process, they develop key 21st Century Competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking, collaboration, and communication, while refining
their use of voice, movement, and staging to convey meaning effectively.</p>
