#### What is Education and Career Guidance (ECG)?

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate the value of all occupations.

### ECG in Tampines Secondary School

In Tampines Secondary School, our school vision is to grow our students to be a Learner, Thinker and Leader. In this VUCA world, some jobs which are relevant today may not exist in future. To overcome the evolving job landscape, we hope to equip our students to be learners with the Growth Mindset who seeks continuous improvement and work towards academic and co-curricular excellence.

We aim to create the learning experiences for students to be able to inspire self-discovery of knowledge. Through our ECG programmes, we hope that students are able to demonstrate initiative and work systematically towards their education and career targets. We would like to cultivate our students to be reflective in connecting their learning with the world around them and relate their learning to the real world. These skills would be useful to the students when they join the future workforce.
