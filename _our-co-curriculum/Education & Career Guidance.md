<h4>What is Education and Career Guidance (ECG)?</h4>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of
purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability
and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate
the value of all occupations.</p>

<h3>ECG in Tampines Secondary School</h3>
<p>In Tampines Secondary School, our school vision is to grow our students
to be a Learner, Thinker and Leader. In this VUCA world, some jobs which
are relevant today may not exist in future. To overcome the evolving job
landscape, we hope to equip our students to be learners with the Growth
Mindset who seeks continuous improvement and work towards academic and
co-curricular excellence.</p>
<p>We aim to create the learning experiences for students to be able to inspire
self-discovery of knowledge. Through our ECG programmes, we hope that students
are able to demonstrate initiative and work systematically towards their
education and career targets. We would like to cultivate our students to
be reflective in connecting their learning with the world around them and
relate their learning to the real world. These skills would be useful to
the students when they join the future workforce.</p>
