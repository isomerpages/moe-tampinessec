**Overseas Learning Experiences for Intercultural Understanding**  

  

Overseas learning journey are valuable school experiences in which students have the opportunity to gain deeper understanding of other cultures outside of Singapore.

  

In 2025, our school is organizing 4 such learning journeys for our Secondary Two and Three students. They are

* **4 Days 3 Nights TRIP TO KOTA KINABALU, SABAH (English, Literature, Art & Ecostewardship)**  --  completed
* **4 Days 3 Nights TRIP TO KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA (Malay)** -- completed

* **5 Days 4 Nights TRIP TO HO CHI MINH, VIETNAM (Humanities)**
* **5 Days 4 Nights TRIP TO BANGKOK, THAILAND (Student Leadership)**



The trips encourage students to value their own cultures and beliefs and those of others from diverse cultures.

The school collaborates with local schools and organises school immersion as part of the learning experience. During the visits to the local schools, our students would interact with the local peers. We also organise visits to local cultural sites to expose them to the rich history and heritage of each country. These activities help our students be more culturally sensitive and appreciative of Singapore as they reflect on the commonalities and differences between Singapore and the country of visit.

The school also believes that these extended learning platforms teach students valuable lessons such as empathy, respect and their responsibility as a Singapore Citizen.
