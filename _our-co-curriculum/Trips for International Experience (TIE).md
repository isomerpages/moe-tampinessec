<p>The trips encourage students to value their own cultures and beliefs and
those of others from diverse cultures.</p>
<p>The school collaborates with local schools and organises school immersion
as part of the learning experience. During the visits to the local schools,
our students would interact with the local peers. We also organise visits
to local cultural sites to expose them to the rich history and heritage
of each country. These activities help our students be more culturally
sensitive and appreciative of Singapore as they reflect on the commonalities
and differences between Singapore and the country of visit.</p>
<p>The school also believes that these extended learning platforms teach
students valuable lessons such as empathy, respect and their responsibility
as a Singapore Citizen.</p>
