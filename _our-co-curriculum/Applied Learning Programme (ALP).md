### WHAT IS ALP?

Applied Learning is a Maker education approach to authentic and practice-oriented learning. The purpose of the&nbsp;Applied Learning Programme (ALP)&nbsp;is to&nbsp;help students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum with regards to the real world, and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire new knowledge and skills.  
  

At Tampines Secondary School, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) employs an active learning pedagogy through making to provide students with opportunities to explore and experiment with technologies in&nbsp;Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).&nbsp;The programme aims to imbue students with a Maker mindset and equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills.

### OVERVIEW

<center>TPSS Applied Learning Programme: <br>
Creative Engineering <br>
Tinker, Design, Innovate </center>

**Why it matters:**

There is a need to prepare our youth for a future that is increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and uncertain (VUCA). The STEM ALP imbibes in our students the appreciation, acquisition, and application of STEM related skills and technologies.

Through the ALP, our students will be curious and creative problem solvers who can appreciate the broader applications of STEM.

By discovering their own talents and interest in STEM, students may in future consider related pursuits in their post-secondary education.&nbsp;

**The ALP is structured into Tier 1 &amp; Tier 2:**

**ALP Tier 1**&nbsp;targets all students.

In Sec 1, students have hands-on learning experiences in Upcycling and Drones (aka Quad-copters) before forming themselves into Junior Tech Start-up groups to solve a real-world challenge related to the theme “Water” or “Technology”.

In Sec 2, students have hands-on learning experiences in constructing a solar toy car and learning coding with Microbits before forming Junior Tech Start-up groups to solve a real-world challenge related to “Energy” or “Aging”.

All ALP sessions occur in a Maker Hub, equipped with 3D printers, laser cutters, and electronics kits. Post-exam Mass Tinkering activities further fuel student interest in hands-on making.

**ALP Tier 2** targets STEM-enthusiastic students, offering an open-door Maker Hub for student-led projects under the guidance of Maker student leaders and support staff.

Highly passionate students identified through Direct School Admissions (DSA), CCA trials, or other means join the talent development track via Maker Faire CCA. This advanced program involves competitions, exhibitions, and showcases, with expert makers and trainers regularly invited for skill development. International trips for broadening cultural perspectives are planned but currently on hold due to the ongoing pandemic.
