### WHAT IS ALP?

Applied Learning is a Maker education approach to authentic and practice-oriented learning. The purpose of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is to help students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum with regards to the real world, and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire new knowledge and skills.  
  

At Tampines Secondary School, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) employs an active learning pedagogy through making to provide students with opportunities to explore and experiment with technologies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The programme aims to imbue students with a Maker mindset and equip them with the relevant knowledge and skills.
