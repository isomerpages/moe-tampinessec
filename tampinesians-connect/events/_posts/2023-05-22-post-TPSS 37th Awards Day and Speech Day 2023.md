On the 9th and 12th of May respectively, Tampines Secondary School joyously commemorated its 37th Annual Awards Day and Speech Day. These twin events not only celebrated the spectrum of academic and co-curricular accomplishments but also served as a platform for our students to spotlight their talents. Embodying this year's theme, 'With Compassion and Courage, Growing Stronger Together', we celebrated the undying Tampinesian spiritâ€”a spirit that compels us to stand firm for our convictions, fortified by a shared empathy. This theme underscores the role of compassion and courage in shaping a resilient and supportive community. By demonstrating empathy and courage in overcoming challenges, we believe we can foster growth and achieve more together than we could individually.<br>
