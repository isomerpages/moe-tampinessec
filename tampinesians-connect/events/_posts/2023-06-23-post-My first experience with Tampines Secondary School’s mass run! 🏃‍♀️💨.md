Dressed in class tees and shorts, my friends and I headed for the venue, Bedok Reservoir. We soon spotted a huge crowd – there was a colourful array of students and teachers bustling around under a huge tentage. Shortly enough, the event started and we lined up one by one for the different racing groups.

The sun was shining and the sky was a brilliant blue with hardly any clouds in sight as we walked forward with no particular sense of urgency. I found myself admiring the scenery surrounding the reservoir, the greenery and buildings, all the while complaining to my friends about the unbearable Singapore heat.

At first glance, the whole trail seemed to be impossibly long but we found that we were making progress pretty fast, making it to the finish line in about 1 hour.

I felt quite accomplished and realised the trek was better than I had thought it would be. The prize-giving ceremony was next and we all sat under the tent, which was stiflingly hot and humid from the weather and the amount of sweaty people crammed together. Finally, we ended the event with a quick clean-up of any scattered rubbish we could find and said our goodbyes.

The whole event was honestly pretty fun! I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, being someone who's not generally sporty. The main reason was probably because my friends were there to liven up the affair but it was still a good first experience at the mass run!
