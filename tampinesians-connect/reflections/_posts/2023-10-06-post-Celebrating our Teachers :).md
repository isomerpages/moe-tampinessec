<p><strong>Written by:</strong> Emma Faith Le Shuen Shuen (3E2)</p><p>It was yet another exciting day to look forward to in Tampines Secondary School as students gathered enthusiastically to celebrate an important day for the teachers – Teacher’s Day. Students arrived at school with arms full of gifts, ready to present them to their deeply appreciated teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>The day kicked off with a surprise party held in each classroom, which was painstakingly planned by the students. They had worked hard to decorate their classrooms, some with a designated food area and many with whiteboards adorned with well wishes for their beloved teachers. Happy voices and laughter from the classrooms filled the air as students got the opportunity to catch up with their teachers and interact with them on this special day, and they also played exciting games and ate with one another.</p><p>After the class parties, the students headed to the hall for the main highlight of the day. Loud cheers and screams were then heard as the all the teachers walked down the runway in the middle of the hall. One of the segments that I found especially fun was when the students got to take part in an interactive guessing game where they had to guess who a particular teacher was based on an item which that teacher was known to have.</p><p>All in all, it was certainly an unforgettable experience for all teachers and students. Teacher’s Day is definitely be an event that all of us look forward to every year.</p>
