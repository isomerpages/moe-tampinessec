Considering that this year is my first time studying Social Studies, I was thrilled to be able to go on this learning journey to the Harmony In Diversity Gallery. This was especially so since this learning journey had limited spots and I knew I was lucky to be able to go for it. 

As we were getting comfortable in the bus seats, the teacher in charge, Mr Ivan, gave out instructions on our expected behaviour. Time flew by as we chatted with one another and soon, we had reached our destination. 

We were greeted by our instructors once we reached the gallery. They would give us an indoor tour of the gallery and take us to explore the historically rich streets of Telok Ayer and Amoy, as this learning journey was for the Secondary Three classes to learn more about and understand the harmony and diversity of Singaporeans.

In the gallery, our instructor explained the importance of diversity and why it was necessary for Singapore as a multicultural and multi-religious country. In hopes to foster a spirit of give and take, mutual respect and understanding was necessary to nurture and strengthen the religious peace and harmony we enjoy today. We were given the very fascinating opportunity to look at all the different cultures that Singapore was home to.

The roads of Telok Ayer and Amoy Street are home to several historically significant sites and National Monuments. My favourite monument was the ACS House. It was the first Anglo-Chinese School in Singapore and was started by Methodist missionaries with just 13 pupils along Amoy Street on 1 March 1886. Now called ACS House, this place has been classified as a historical site since the late 1990s.

After the tour, we headed back to the gallery to thank the instructors and wait for our bus to come. The learning journey was honestly incredibly fun as I got the opportunity to learn more about Singapore’s cultures and bond with classmates of different religions. 

My classmate Leiniz also agreed with me, saying, “I had a lot was fun because I got to explore famous buildings that have been there for a long time, as well as learn about their history.”
