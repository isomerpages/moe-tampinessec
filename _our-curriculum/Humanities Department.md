### MISSION VISION

**The Humanities Department’s vision is:**   

Learners who embrace their role as global citizens who are able to manage complexity, ambiguities and diverse perspectives in an increasingly globalized world through being able to think critically and flexibly when faced with issues and challenges  

**Its Mission is:** 

Teach and Inspire Tampinesians with a concern for the world and to do their best as useful and contributing citizens for the world they live in  
  

**Its Aims are:** 

*   To develop a genuine interest and an understanding of Geography and History or Social Studies at the lower secondary levels
*   To generate thinking and passion in students about subjects taught through conceptual understanding and skill acquisition
*   To strengthen students’ appreciation of subjects to real-life through making connections between learning and real-life issues and challenges 

  

The department seeks to develop critical thinkers who are able to work collaboratively with one another. The key programmes are designed to provide students with an appreciation and understanding of the Humanities disciplines, at the same time equipping them with useful skills such as research, perspective-taking and decision making.

**2. History Competitions**

  

Students from Lower Secondary were exposed to a variety of competitions such as the Singapore History Day competition and the Istana Heritage Gallery competition. Such competitions help them to better appreciate Singapore’s history.
