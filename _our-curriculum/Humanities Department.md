<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Humanities Trip to Vietnam for Secondary 3 Students</h4>
<p>In October 2024, Tampines Secondary School embarked on a Humanities Learning
Journey to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Students visited Minh Duc Secondary
School, where they experienced local student life and built friendships
with their Vietnamese peers. They also explored the Cu Chi Tunnels and
War Remnants Museum to understand Vietnam’s historical struggles and significance,
and travelled along the Mekong Delta River to appreciate key geographical
concepts. Immersive cultural activities and daily interactions with locals
further deepened students’ appreciation of diversity and culture. Through
these experiences, students broadened their perspectives and strengthened
their sense of commitment and rootedness to Singapore.</p>

<h4>Hosting of Minh Duc School (Vietnam)</h4>
<p>In May 2025, Tampines Secondary School hosted students and teachers from
Minh Duc Secondary School, Vietnam, as part of our Humanities Exchange
Programme. The exchange created a meaningful platform for both sets of
students to experience each other’s educational environments and cultures
from an ASEAN perspective. Visiting students joined classroom lessons alongside
their Singaporean peers and participated in a local learning journey to
Chinatown, Kampong Glam, and Gardens by the Bay. These experiences not
only showcased Singapore’s rich cultural heritage but also deepened mutual
understanding and friendships, reinforcing the value of cross-cultural
learning and regional ties.</p>
