### Vision
Understanding Science, Appreciating Life

### Mission
In Tampines Secondary School, we aim to
*   enthuse and nurture students to be scientifically literate
*   provide strong fundamentals in science knowledge and skills to innovate and purse STEM for future learning and work

We provide students with Authentic, Constructivist and Experiential Science learning experiences to do so. We envision our students to be
*   inspired by science
*   inquire like scientists
*   innovate using science

### Key Programmes
#### Secondary 1
The LSS at Sec 1 employs a thematic, inquiry-based approach to science education. Under the Diversity theme, students explore variety and commonalities to deepen their understanding of the world. In the Models theme, they learn how physical and conceptual frameworks aid in understanding unobservable phenomena. All Sec 1 students engage in an end-of-year in-house experiential learning programme.
#### Secondary 2
The LSS at Sec 2 likewise utilises a thematic, inquiry-based approach to science education. In the Systems theme, students explore how system components and inputs influence outputs. The Interactions theme covers energy transfer, force application, and their effects on system stability or change. All Sec 2 students partake in a mid-year in-house experiential learning programme.
#### Upper Secondary (3-5)
We offer a myriad of subject combinations to our upper secondary students, which include all three Pure Sciences (Chemistry, Physics, Biology) and Combined Sciences (Chemistry/Physics or Chemistry/Biology).

Note: Secondary 3 Students will get the chance to participate in engaging experiential learning programmes offered by the Science Center or Temasek Polytechnic.

#### Stretch Programme
Selected Sec 1 to 3 students who show an aptitude for Science are selected for a science stretch program. They will be exposed to more scientific phenomena to broaden their knowledge and skills.

### Highlights & Achievements
#### Science Stretch Programme
The Science Stretch programme serves as a platform for students who exhibit aptitude and interest in science to explore their scientific passions, develop experimental skills, and lay a strong foundation for future academic and professional success in the field of science. This year, selected Sec 3 students participated actively in an educational program focused on the study of biodegradable bag, bioplastics and soap making.
