### MISSION VISION

**Vision**

"Understanding Science, appreciating life"

**Mission**

In Tampines Secondary School, we aim to provide students with Authentic, Constructivist and Experiential Science learning experiences to build a strong foundation in Science knowledge and its applications in daily life. This would in turn develop in students

*   the spirit of scientific inquiry and innovations and
*   an interest in the subject which will help them to understand their roles in society and work.
