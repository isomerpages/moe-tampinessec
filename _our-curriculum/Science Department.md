<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Understanding Science, Appreciating Life</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to ignite curiosity, foster critical and creative thinking,
and build a strong foundation in scientific knowledge and skills. We aim
to nurture students who are curious learners, analytical thinkers, and
innovative problem-solvers, empowered to apply science meaningfully in
real-world contexts. Through authentic and experiential learning, we prepare
our students to confidently pursue STEM pathways and to contribute as responsible,
future-ready individuals.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Science Stretch Programme</h4>
<p>The Science Stretch Programme provides the students with opportunities
to generate and refine ideas to address real-world problems while exploring
sustainable solutions. Through the process, they learn to persevere by
viewing failures as opportunities for growth. They also discover the importance
of staying open-minded, creative, and imaginative when considering different
possibilities to solve problems.</p>
<p>The Science Stretch programme serves as a platform for students who exhibit
aptitude and interest in science to explore their scientific passions,
develop experimental skills, and lay a strong foundation for future academic
and professional success in the field of science. Selected Sec 3 students
participated in the International Elementz Fair organised by Anderson Serangoon
JC in 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Science Experiential Learning Programme</h4>
<p>Offering a dynamic and engaging approach to science education, the science
experiential learning programme immerses students in hands-on experiences,
igniting a love for learning, and the development of inquiry skills.</p>
