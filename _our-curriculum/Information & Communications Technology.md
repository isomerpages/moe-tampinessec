### NATIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME ( NDLP)

The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to make digital learning inclusive by equipping students with the digital literacies to be future-ready.

Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will own a school-prescribed personal learning device (PLD) by end 2021. Singapore Citizen students can use their Edusave Account to pay for the PLD.

The device will facilitate an environment that encourages personalised learning.

**At Tampines Secondary School, we hope to develop your child to be**

*   responsible online users who use the online resources to reflect and advance on his/ her learning.
*   able to make use of online information to infer and make informed decisions to problem solve issues in real world context.
*   well versed in the use of technology to choose the right tools for learning and communication.

**Please refer to the Parents’ Letter which has been sent through Parents’ Gateway for more details on this programme.**

**Following is the deck of slides which had been shared during the Parents’ Engagement Session:**

### Developing responsible and discerning users of ICT
In collaboration with the Arts Department, a Cyberwellness Art Competition is also organised to bring about greater Cyberwellness awareness. At the same time, the department works closely with the Infocomm Club to provide students with opportunties to research and then share with their peers on the topic of Cyberwellness during assembly programme.

To encourage intergeneration bonding, IT bootcamps were also conducted in parternership with IMDA. During this bootcamp, our students share with elderly community members on how to make use of social media platforms such as Facebook and some online safety knowledge
