<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>Future-ready, Responsible, Empowered and Effective (F.R.E.E.) digital
collaborators in a technology transformed learning environment.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To equip students with the awareness and skills to embrace technology
as a capability multiplier to bring the world to our classroom.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p>The NDLP was launched in March 2020 to&nbsp;make digital learning inclusive&nbsp;by&nbsp;equipping
students with the digital literacies&nbsp;to be future-ready.</p>
<p>Through the NDLP, all secondary school students will&nbsp;own a school-prescribed&nbsp;personal
learning&nbsp;device (PLD)&nbsp;by end 2021.&nbsp;Singapore Citizen students
can use their&nbsp;Edusave Account&nbsp;to pay for the PLD.</p>
<p>The device will&nbsp;facilitate an environment that&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p><strong>At&nbsp;Tampines Secondary School, we hope to develop your child to be</strong>
</p>

<h3>Staff Training and Cluster/ National/ International Sharings</h3>

<p>They also attended external sharings to learn from teachers of other schools.</p>
<h3>Equipping students and staff with a wider range of ICT resources</h3>

<h3>Providing our students with authentic learning experiences</h3>
<p>ICT is infused into daily curriculum through the use of SLS or online
interactive tools. In addition to this, ICT is also infused into learning
tasks or experiences such as Authentic Problem Solving tasks or ‘Learning
on The Move [LOTM] trail.</p>

<h3>Developing responsible and discerning users of ICT</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Arts Department, a Cyberwellness Art Competition
is also organised to bring about greater Cyberwellness awareness. At the
same time, the department works closely with the Infocomm Club to provide
students with opportunties to research and then share with their peers
on the topic of Cyberwellness during assembly programme.</p>
<p>To encourage intergeneration bonding, IT bootcamps were also conducted
in parternership with IMDA. During this bootcamp, our students share with
elderly community members on how to make use of social media platforms
such as Facebook and some online safety knowledge</p>
