<h3>Cognitive Apprenticeship Model</h3>
<p>The Craft and Technology department uses the Cognitive Apprenticeship
Model as a framework for active learning and to make thinking visible.
The Cognitive Apprenticeship model consists of Modeling, Coaching, Scaffolding,
Fading and Reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Modeling and Coaching:</strong>&nbsp;Through online subject portals,
SLS and Google classrooms, instructional videos and just-in-time coaching
are made readily available to students for asynchronous learning. This
allows students to take learning beyond their classrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding and Fading:</strong>&nbsp;C&amp;T department programmes
are designed to help students learn independently and progressively. Online
resources, resource booklets and activities are carefully planned and designed
each year to scaffold learning. Through fading, students are given opportunities
to take ownership of their own learning to be independent and/or self-directed
learners.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection:</strong>&nbsp;Both staff and students carry a mindset
of life-long learning through regular reflections. Staff have weekly professional
development discussions to review and improve C&amp;T department programmes.
Students are also given opportunities to consistently reflect on their
own learning at critical junctures. &nbsp; These efforts reflect our strong
commitment to nurture students’ creativity and inventive skills in the
Arts and Applied Sciences; to make every student a creative thinker.</p>
