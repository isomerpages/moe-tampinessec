### Cognitive Apprenticeship Model 
The Craft and Technology department uses the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model as a framework for active learning and to make thinking visible. The Cognitive Apprenticeship model consists of Modeling, Coaching, Scaffolding, Fading and Reflection.

**Modeling and Coaching:**&nbsp;Through online subject portals, SLS and Google classrooms, instructional videos and just-in-time coaching are made readily available to students for asynchronous learning. This allows students to take learning beyond their classrooms.

**Scaffolding and Fading:**&nbsp;C&amp;T department programmes are designed to help students learn independently and progressively. Online resources, resource booklets and activities are carefully planned and designed each year to scaffold learning. Through fading, students are given opportunities to take ownership of their own learning to be independent and/or self-directed learners.

**Reflection:**&nbsp;Both staff and students carry a mindset of life-long learning through regular reflections. Staff have weekly professional development discussions to review and improve C&amp;T department programmes. Students are also given opportunities to consistently reflect on their own learning at critical junctures. &nbsp; These efforts reflect our strong commitment to nurture students’ creativity and inventive skills in the Arts and Applied Sciences; to make every student a creative thinker.
