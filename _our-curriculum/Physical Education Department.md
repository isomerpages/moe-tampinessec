### Key Programmes
**Overview of PE Programmme in Tampines Secondary School**

The 2014 PE syllabus articulates an inclusive approach to physical education and sports development and a nation of active and physically competent individuals. Thus, in Tampines Secondary School, the PE department believes in equipping our students with **broad-based knowledge** of different sports and provide opportunities for exploration of interest.

Across the years in TPSS, our students will experience physical health and fitness conditioning, running module, principle of games, skills acquisition in sports like football, netball, badminton, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, tag rugby, softball, floorball, tchoukball and outdoor education.

**Key Programmes**
**Principles of Games**
The Principle of Games or POG is based on the concept of Teaching Games for Understanding which was developed by researchers at Loughborough University. It focuses on student learning through playing games.

Our students were taught games principles under the following 3 categories:
1.  Net/Barrier
2.  Striking/Fielding
3.  Invasion/Territorial

POG's main idea is:
1.  Break the games down into key ideas and concepts and allowing our students to play even with a beginner’s ability.
2.  Highlight the transference of games concepts across sports within the same category.

#### Outdoor Education
The Outdoor Education lessons provide the foundation for the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will enable students to be comfortable and safe in the outdoors.

The module provides opportunities for theoretical concepts such as risk management to be enacted in authentic outdoor settings. It focuses on three strands:

1.  Enhancing physical health and wellbeing;
2.  Building competency in assessing and managing risk; and
3.  Developing a sense of place.

#### MOE-OBS Challenge
MOE-OBS Challenge was introduced with these objectives in mind:
1.  Develop well-rounded individuals
2.  Outdoor Education (OE) provides rich learning experiences outside the classroom and helps our students to develop holistically, building up their resilience and ruggedness
3.  Authentic learning experiences help our students to develop 21st century competencies as well as competencies for sustainable, active and healthy living

Every year, it has become a rite of passage for our Secondary 3 students to go through the programme.
