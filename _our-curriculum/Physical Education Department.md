### Key Programmes
**Overview of PE Programmme in Tampines Secondary School**

The 2014 PE syllabus articulates an inclusive approach to physical education and sports development and a nation of active and physically competent individuals. Thus, in Tampines Secondary School, the PE department believes in equipping our students with **broad-based knowledge** of different sports and provide opportunities for exploration of interest.

Across the years in TPSS, our students will experience physical health and fitness conditioning, running module, principle of games, skills acquisition in sports like football, netball, badminton, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, tag rugby, softball, floorball, tchoukball and outdoor education.

**Principles of Games**
The Principle of Games or POG is based on the concept of Teaching Games for Understanding which was developed by researchers at Loughborough University. It focuses on student learning through playing games.

Our students were taught games principles under the following 3 categories:
1.  Net/Barrier
2.  Striking/Fielding
3.  Invasion/Territorial

POG's main idea is:
1.  Break the games down into key ideas and concepts and allowing our students to play even with a beginner’s ability.
2.  Highlight the transference of games concepts across sports within the same category.
