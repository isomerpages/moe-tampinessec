<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>A department that develops the whole person.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>We are committed to develop our pupils holistically through a wide array
of programmes based on the school’s strategic thrusts and shared values.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Overview of PE Programmme in Tampines Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>The PE syllabus has been refreshed in 2025 and articulates an <strong>inclusive approach</strong> to
physical education and sports development and a nation of <strong>active and physically competent individuals</strong>.
Thus, in Tampines Secondary School, the PE department believes in equipping
our students with <strong>broad-based knowledge of different sports</strong> and
providing opportunities for exploration of interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Across the years in TPSS, our students will experience physical health
and fitness conditioning, Running Module, Principles of Games, Outdoor
Education and skills acquisition in various sports like football, netball,
badminton, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, tag rugby, softball, floorball,
pickleball and tchoukball. On top of the daily curriculum, the PE Department
also runs various highlight programmes which underpin the student experience
in Tampines Secondary School.</p>
<h4>Secondary 1 &amp; 3 Level Camps</h4>
<p>As part of the National Outdoor Adventure Education Masterplan, the programme
seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience, and build cohesion amongst our
students.</p>
<p>Through the camp, or students will be able to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learn about themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build friendships amongst their team and actively help each other to achieve
team goals in an inclusive manner; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the importance of caring for the environment</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>TPSS Inter-Class Games</h4>
<p>The Inter-Class Games are conducted across the levels to foster camaraderie
amongst peers and to provide an additional platform for students to display
sportsmanship, team-work and leadership qualities.</p>
<h4>TPSS Mass Run</h4>
<p>The TPSS Mass Run is an annual event held:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To inculcate a culture of healthy living amongst our staff, students and
parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an outlet of friendly competition for Tampinesians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an authentic environment to demonstrate our school values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Tampines Secondary School Flag Ceremony</h4>
<p>CCAs are an important and integral part of our holistic education. Students
develop their interests through their participation in CCAs as they learn
values and life skills, develop their identity, build relationships, and
learn to make the right choices that prepare them for the future beyond
school.</p>
<p>The CCA Flags are a symbol for students’ affiliation and CCA pride. The
ceremony symbolises the school entrusting the various CCAs to develop students
holistically and allowing students to feel proud of their CCAs.</p>
<p>The flag ceremony is also held in conjunction with the start of our National
School Games. This is where our student athletes take their athletes oath
for fair play at the games. It is also a time for the for the school to
show their support for the hard work and dedication these student athletes
put in to represent the school in their individual sports.</p>
<h4>TPSS Boardminton</h4>
<p>The PE department team conceptualized the idea of using board game to
teach the tactical concepts in Net-barrier games. The Boardminton project
started in 2019 and the final product was finally completed in Nov 2021.
In 2022, the board game was used as a teaching tool to aid in the teaching
of tactical concepts in badminton which was a sport that was taught at
the Secondary 3 level.</p>
<p>Through the game, we were able to engage students and teach them concepts
that might not have happened in the game-play due to the student’s technical
ability. The students very quickly grasped the concept of attacking and
defending space in badminton.</p>

<p>During one of the school’s staff sharing session, the PE department shared
the project with the rest of the school staff who agreed that the board
game was fun and engaging. The department also subsequently shared the
project as one of the presentations during the TCEF 2023 Conference and
was well received by its attendees.</p>
